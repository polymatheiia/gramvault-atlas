"""Import/ingestion API (Agent A2).

Owns: uploading an Instagram data export ZIP, unpacking it, creating
authors/items/media_files rows, and tracking progress via `import_jobs`
so a failed/interrupted import can resume rather than restart.

The actual parsing/organizing/DB-writing logic lives in
`gramvault.ingestion` (shared with the `gramvault import` CLI command —
see `gramvault.cli.import_export`) so there's exactly one implementation
behind both entry points.

    The upload is saved under `config.resolved_imports_dir` (never

    `library_dir`, since that's served at `/media` and a "Download Your
    Information" export can contain far more than saved posts (audit
    finding S8). Import runs synchronously for v1 — a saved-posts+media
    ZIP processes fast enough that a background queue isn't worth the
    extra moving parts yet; A3 owns the (separately long-running)
    enrichment background queue.

    A ZIP that doesn't look like a real Instagram export doesn't raise an
    HTTP error here — it comes back as a normal `ImportJob` with
    `status="failed"` and a friendly `error_message`, so the frontend can
    show it inline rather than having to special-case a 4xx/5xx. The
    uploaded ZIP is deleted after a successful import; kept on failure so
    it can be inspected/retried.
